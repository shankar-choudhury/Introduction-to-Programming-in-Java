# Introduction-to-Programming-in-Java
Look here for my first coding assignments out of college. This branch holds all of the coding projects/assignments, labs, pre-labs, and coding challenge exercises I successfully implemented in CWRU's Programming in Java class. Although it is listed as a introductory course, it is more appropriate to think of it as an in-depth survey to programming in Java 8 that includes proper OOP practices, linked lists, introductory Functional Programming in Java, and utilization of the Java API and it's libraries.
